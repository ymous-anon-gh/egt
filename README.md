# Edge-augmented Graph Transformer (PyTorch)

## Introduction

This is the official implementation of the **Edge-augmented Graph Transformer (EGT)**, which augments the Transformer architecture with residual edge channels. The resultant architecture can directly process graph-structured data. To reproduce the medium-scale results view the `medium_scale` directory. To reproduce the large-scale results see the `large_scale_and_transfer_learning` directory.
